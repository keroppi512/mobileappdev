            <p>My dog Lulu has been with my family for over 2 years now. Here are some facts about her!<br>
                <ul class="facts">
                    <li>She has 15 different breeds in her blood, including bulldog, laborador retriever, and beagle.</li><br>
                    <li>She HATES the rain. She refuses to go outside in the rain.</li><br>
                    <li>She is much more lively at night, while she is subdued and sleepy in the morning.</li><br>
                </ul>
                She can get quite unruly, and does things such as push food into her water dish
                and run around the living room at terminal velocity at 10pm. However, we still 
                love her despite her little quirks. She is a very loving dog and has brightened up
                everyone's life. Our family simply would not be the same without her.
