            <p>This site is a love letter of sorts to my best friend in the world, Lulu. <br><br>I wanted to make something 
                special because she might just be one of the most special parts of my life. She has helped me through 
                dark times, simply by being there for me, as emotional support and a play mate. Thank you Lulu, here's 
                to many more years of cuddles and slobbery kisses!!
